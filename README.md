# Cyclist-Detection

According to research from the World Health Organization (WHO), it has been observed that cyclists have a significant impact on global traffic accident fatality statistics, contributing 3% to the total number of deaths. In Colombia, this figure is even higher, reaching 5% (World Health Organization, 2018). This highlights the importance of effectively addressing the safety challenges faced by cyclists on the roads, recognizing the need to implement preventive and protective measures. Additionally, it is crucial to consider that detecting and preventing collisions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and cyclists represent a significant challenge. The environments in which cyclists travel are often dynamic and changing, making it difficult to anticipate their movements and behaviors.

From a technical standpoint, the accurate identification of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) remains one of the most challenging environment perception tasks for AVs. In fact, bicycles are arguably the most difficult detection problem faced by autonomous vehicle systems (Fairley, 2017; Mannion, 2019). Therefore, it will be necessary to enhance VRU detection capabilities to a level of human performance or beyond in the coming years, so that autonomous vehicles can minimize the risk they pose to VRUs.
